<!-- PROBLEM: Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numebrs
    from one to the number the user entered. However, if multiples of three print 'Fizz'
    instead of the numeber and for multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are
    multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz' -->

<!-- ALGORITHM 
    1) Whe a user inputs a number
    2) Loop from 1 to the entered number 
    3) If the current number is divisible by 3 then print 'Fizz'
    4) If the current number is divisible by 5 then print 'Buzz'
    5) If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print 'Fizzbuzz' // This takes top priority
    6) Otherwise print the current number -->

    <script>
        // Stores input from prompt
        let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the numebr you would like to Fizzbuz up to: "));

        // Loops from 1 to the entered number and prints to console, which invokes i
        for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    </script>
